## the structure/content of the python notebook are listed as follows:


Features from pretrained models like VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, InceptionV3 and MobileNet

Benchmark feature extraction speed with different model 

finetuned MobileNet with caltech101 labeled data

(TODO)Reduce feature dimension 

Index feature list with Nearest Neighbor Brute Force Algorithm and visualize with PCA and t-SNE

Query accuracy with Euclidean L2  vs  cosine vs regular Euclidean distance

with SOA ANN index and query

The question is that how to determine the threshold value? Most resources skip this determination step. In this post, we will learn how to find the best split point for a threshold.( what to return and what not to )
